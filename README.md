# simpsons_prediction_app
The project is based on the use of a machine learning model trained on a large dataset of The Simpsons. 
The model is trained to recognize different characters based on different features, such as colors, shapes, etc. 
To recognize characters in an image, the user enters an image through an input field, after which the model is applied to that image. 
After the model analyzes the image, it gives an answer as to which character is shown in the image.
